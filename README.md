# Mitch builds a guitar

## The plan

I've always had a bit of an "it'll work out in the end" kind of attitude to making things, so I usually start with the bare minimum of plans and try and adapt to the problems as I come across them. So, I only had a very rough idea of how I wanted this guitar to look in my head. I wanted a big-body jazz-guitar, to resemble a [Gretsch Bo Diddley](http://www.gretschguitars.com/gear/build/solid-body/g6138-bo-diddley-filter-tron-pickups-firebird-red), but with an angular offset a bit like a [Fender Jazzmaster](https://shop.fender.com/en/intl/electric-guitars/jazzmaster/standard-jazzmaster-hh/0149500505.html#start=1). I drew the roughtest of sketches, and it looks like this:

I've built a couple of cigar-box guitars, repurposing odd bits of hardware from junk-shops and dollar stores, but I wanted this build to resemble more of a 'store bought' guitar. So, I collected a neck, and most of the hardware (except some bits and pieces I had spare in my guitar-bits box) from Aliexpress and [guitarparts.co.nz](https://www.guitarparts.co.nz/).

Couldn't believe the value for money, frets are all dead-level and nicely crowned, which is the important bits. Couple of scuffs and some little indentations in wood, but for $22 (including shipping) I couldn't be happier.

Tidy appearance, no idea if they're any good, no way to tell either. Unsure whether genuine Epiphone, but it's not a particularly valuable brand so don't know why anyone would manufacture knock-offs. Proof will be in the pudding.

Bridge, machine heads ("tuners"), graphite nut, pickup selector switch and neck-plate from [guitarparts.co.nz](https://www.guitarparts.co.nz/). Decent price, only about 2 weeks shipping time, which is not bad for guitar hardware in NZ. probably a total of ~100NZD worth of parts here, the biggest expense of the project. Could have spent twice as much getting quality brand parts, but can always upgrade later.

## The build

It all began with a trip to bunnings, where I purchased a 90x42x1800mm length of their finest dressed-four-sides Pinus Radiata. It was about 30% longer than I needed, so that I had an opportunity to f*** up the routing/cutting a couple of times.

The first and arguably most important cut, was to route out the "neck pocket" (the recess that the neck would be wedged, glued and screwed into). Despite the warnings of every luthier on the internet, I tried to freehand it first. I quickly failed, and resigned to creating a routing template (AKA "routing jig").

We tracked the neck heel onto a scrap piece of MDF and measure one router-radius outwards (minus the router-bit radius) from the trace with a pair of calipers. Then we cut out that outer trace, leaving behind a big U-shaped piece of MDF which would become our routing jig. The idea is that you can screw or clamp the jig onto your timber, place the router on the inside of the jig, and route away the entire inner space.

Take 1, routed outline - just before we changed to a bigger router bit to route out the bulk in the middle.

This was actually fairly successful, though the pocket was about 1mm too wide in all dimensions, so the neck wobbled around a little bit in there. So, I ran about 3 layers of electrical tape around the inside of the jig to effectively make the jig ~1mm thinner, then started again.

![phallic-routing-slip](phallic-routing-slip.jpg)
Take 2 - the router bit slipped somehow, and we ended up with this rather phallic piece. Off it was sliced.

Take 3 - see the tape around the inside of the jig, closing the radius slightly.

Checking whether the neck fits its pocket - snug as a rug.

Next, I had to cut two more cavities beneath the neck pocket for the pickups. The pickups I had bought from Aliexpress were actually going to be a bit of an awkward width for the timber I had bought as it turns out. The cavity would have left about 1mm on either edge, which meant I didn't have any margin for error. So, I abandonded those pickups and used another pair of mini humbuckers that I had leftover from another project which would be a much better fit.

The same process applied for these pickups - we traced around them onto a sheet of scrap wood, then measured outward by one router-radius minus one router-bit-radius, then cut out the resulting shape with a jigsaw.

Then, we screwed the pickup jig down onto the workbench, and routed away the inside.

Testing the size of the pickup cavity.

Then, I tested the width of the resulting cavity by trying to drop one of the pickups into it, and found that it was a bit of a squeeze, so I shuffled the timber along the workbench by 2mm (while leaving the jig in place) and routed it away. I repeated this same process for the second pickup cavity, before moving onto the wiring channel.

The wiring channel is simply a channel that connects any or all cavities in a guitar, which might include pickup cavities, control cavities, pickup-selector switch cavities, and output jack cavities. To keep things simple, I was going to consolidate all of these things into a single cavity on the bottom of the guitar, so on this piece of timber I only needed a single channel which connected the two pickups.

I freehand-routed this particular cavity with the aid of a big straight-edge on one side - making a jig would have been overkill because it was not going to be visible once the body was glue together, so it did not have to be pretty.
