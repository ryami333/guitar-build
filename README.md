# Mitch builds a guitar

## The image in my head...

I've always had a bit of an "it'll work out in the end" kind of attitude to making things, so I usually start with the bare minimum of plans and try and adapt to the problems as I come across them. So, I only had a very rough idea of how I wanted this guitar to look in my head. I wanted a big-body jazz-guitar kind of presence, to resemble a Gretsch Bo Diddley, but with an angular offset not unlike a Gibson Explorer or Fender Jazzmaster. I drew the roughtest of sketches, and it looks like this:

## The scope

I've built a couple of guitar necks from scratch, and frankly they're not usually worth the time. I've also built a couple of cigar-box guitars, repurposing odd bits of hardware from junk-shops and dollar stores, but I wanted this build to resemble more of a 'store bought' guitar. So, I collected a neck, and most of the hardware (except some bits and pieces I had spare in my guitar-bits box) from Aliexpress and guitarparts.co.nz.

![aliexpress-neck](aliexpress-neck.jpg)
22NZD Guitar neck from Aliexpress. Couldn't believe the value for money, frets are all dead-level and nicely crowned, which is the important bits. Couple of scuffs and some little indentations in wood, but for $22 (including shipping) I couldn't be happier.

20NZD-ish pickups from Aliexpress. Tidy appearance, no idea if they're any good, no way to tell either. Unsure whether genuine Epiphone, but it's not a particularly valuable brand so don't know why anyone would manufacture knock-offs. Proof will be in the pudding.

![pickup-selector-switch-and-neck-plate-aliexpress](pickup-selector-switch-and-neck-plate-aliexpress.jpg)
Bridge, machine heads ("tuners"), graphite nut, pickup selector switch and neck-plate from guitar-parts.co.nz. Decent price, only about 2 weeks shipping time, which is not bad for guitar hardware in NZ. probably a total of ~100NZD worth of parts here, the biggest expense of the project. Could have spent twice as much getting quality brand parts, but can always upgrade later.

## The build

It all began with a trip to bunnings, where I purchased one 90x42x1800mm length of their finest dressed-four-sides Pinus Radiata. It was about 30% longer than I needed, so that I had an opportunity to f*** up the routing/cutting a couple of times.

The first and arguably most important cut, was to route out the 'neck pocket' (the recess that the neck would be wedged, glued and screwed into). Despite the warnings of every luthier on the internet, I tried to freehand it first. I quickly failed, and resigned to having to create a routing template (AKA "routing jig").

Measuring and marking one router-radius outwards from the trace of the neck heel. Apologies for photo taken with potato.

We tracked the neck heel onto a scrap piece of MDF and measure one router-radius outwards (minus the router-bit radius) from the trace with a pair of calipers. Then we cut out that outer trace, leaving behind a big U-shaped piece of MDF which would become our routing jig. The idea is that you can screw or clamp the jig onto your timber, place the router on the inside of the jig, and route away the entire inner space.

![routed-neck-pocket-outline-take-1](routed-neck-pocket-outline-take-1.jpg)
Take 1, routed outline - just before we changed to a bigger router bit to route out the bulk in the middle.

This was actually fairly successful, though the pocket was about 1mm too wide in all dimensions, so the neck wobbled around a little bit in there. So, I ran about 3 layers of electrical tape around the inside of the jig to effectively make the jig ~1mm thinner.

Take 2 - the router bit slipped somehow, and we ended up with this rather phallic looking piece. Off it was sliced.

Take 3 - see the tape around the inside of the jig, closing the radius slightly.

Perfect fit.
