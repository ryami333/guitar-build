# Mitch builds a guitar

## The plan

I've always had a bit of an "it'll work out in the end" kind of attitude to making things, so I usually start with the bare minimum of plans and try and adapt to the problems as I come across them. So, I only had a very rough idea of how I wanted this guitar to look in my head. I wanted a big-body jazz-guitar, to resemble a [Gretsch Bo Diddley](http://www.gretschguitars.com/gear/build/solid-body/g6138-bo-diddley-filter-tron-pickups-firebird-red), but with an angular offset a bit like a [Fender Jazzmaster](https://shop.fender.com/en/intl/electric-guitars/jazzmaster/standard-jazzmaster-hh/0149500505.html#start=1). I drew the roughtest of sketches, and it looks like this:

I've built a couple of cigar-box guitars, repurposing odd bits of hardware from junk-shops and dollar stores, but I wanted this build to resemble more of a 'store bought' guitar. So, I collected a neck, and most of the hardware (except some bits and pieces I had spare in my guitar-bits box) from Aliexpress and [guitarparts.co.nz](https://www.guitarparts.co.nz/).

[22USD Guitar neck](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Maple-rosewood-Guitar-Neck-22-Frets-on-Rosewood-Strat-Shred-Neck-Guitar/32826808102.html) from Aliexpress. Couldn't believe the value for money, frets are all dead-level and nicely crowned, which is the important part. Couple of scuffs and some little indentations in wood, but for $22 (including shipping) I couldn't be happier.

Tidy appearance, no idea if they're any good, no way to tell either. Unsure whether genuine Epiphone, but it's not a particularly valuable brand so don't know why anyone would manufacture knock-offs. Proof will be in the pudding.

Bridge, machine heads ("tuners"), graphite nut, pickup selector switch and neck-plate from [guitarparts.co.nz](https://www.guitarparts.co.nz/). Decent price, only about 2 weeks shipping time, which is not bad for guitar hardware in NZ. probably a total of ~100NZD worth of parts here, the biggest expense of the project. Could have spent twice as much getting quality brand parts, but can always upgrade later.

## The build

It all began with a trip to bunnings, where I purchased a 90x42x1800mm length of their finest dressed-four-sides Pinus Radiata. It was about 30% longer than I needed, so that I had an opportunity to f*** up the routing/cutting a couple of times.

The first and arguably most important cut, was to route out the "neck pocket" (the recess that the neck would be wedged, glued and screwed into). Despite the warnings of every luthier on the internet, I tried to freehand it first. I quickly failed, and resigned to creating a routing template (AKA "routing jig").

We traced the neck heel onto a scrap piece of MDF and measure one router-radius outwards (minus the router-bit radius) from the trace with a pair of calipers. Then we cut out that outer trace, leaving behind a big U-shaped piece of MDF which would become our routing jig. The idea is that you can screw or clamp the jig onto your timber, place the router on the inside of the jig, and route away the entire inner space.

![routed-neck-pocket-outline-take-1](routed-neck-pocket-outline-take-1.jpg)
Take 1, routed outline - just before we changed to a bigger router bit to route out the bulk in the middle.

This was actually fairly successful, though the pocket was about 1mm too wide in all dimensions, so the neck wobbled around a little bit in there. So, I ran about 3 layers of electrical tape around the inside of the jig to effectively make the jig ~1mm thinner, then started again.

![phallic-routing-slip](phallic-routing-slip.jpg)
Take 2 - the router bit slipped somehow, and we ended up with this rather phallic piece. Off it was sliced.

Take 3 - see the tape around the inside of the jig, closing the radius slightly.

![completely-routed-neck-pocket](completely-routed-neck-pocket.jpg)
Great success.

![neck-sitting-in-routed-pocket](neck-sitting-in-routed-pocket.jpg)
Checking whether the neck fits its pocket - snug as a rug.

Next, I had to cut two more cavities beneath the neck pocket for the pickups. The pickups I had bought from Aliexpress were actually going to be a bit of an awkward width for the timber I had bought as it turns out. The cavity would have left about 1mm on either edge, which meant I didn't have any margin for error. So, I abandonded those pickups and used another pair of mini humbuckers that I had leftover from another project which would be a much better fit.

The same process applied for these pickups - we traced around them onto a sheet of scrap wood, then measured outward by one router-radius minus one router-bit-radius, then cut out the resulting shape with a jigsaw.

Then, we screwed the pickup jig down onto the workbench, and routed away the inside.

Then, I tested the width of the resulting cavity by trying to drop one of the pickups into it, and found that it was a bit of a squeeze, so I shuffled the timber along the workbench by 2mm (while leaving the jig in place) and routed it away. I repeated this same process for the second pickup cavity, before moving onto the wiring channel.

![routed-centreblock](routed-centreblock.jpg)
Both pickup cavities and neck pocket routed on the centreblock.

The wiring channel is simply a channel that connects any or all cavities in a guitar, which might include pickup cavities, control cavities, pickup-selector switch cavities, and output jack cavities. To keep things simple, I was going to consolidate all of these things into a single cavity on the bottom of the guitar, so on this piece of timber I only needed a single channel which connected the two pickups.

I freehand-routed this particular cavity with the aid of a big straight-edge on one side - making a jig would have been overkill because it was not going to be visible once the body was glue together, so it did not have to be pretty.

![control-channel-routed](control-channel-routed.jpg)

At this point, I was beginning to grow a little tired of the routing, so I decided to do something different and cut the wood into the shape I wanted to make up the body. I had to get a *little* bit more serious with my planning here, because I needed to work out the cutting angle I set the dropsaw to and the length to cut each piece to. I drew the body to my eye, and calculated the resulting angles and lengths.

I used a dropsaw here, which had a configurable cutting angle, which I set to 8degrees to achieve the offest shape I desired.

All cut, with the neck resting in its pocket.

Because I had not been building to an existing template, and all I had to go on was the sketch I'd drawn above, it was hard to know just how big it would *look* in the flesh once I had cut all three pieces, I took this opportunity to rest the neck in its pocket and place all the hardware on the body in its approximate positions, and just take a moment to consider whether I needed to cut it a little shorter. In the end end, I decided I quite liked the size and shape, so I didn't do any more cutting.
 
Once I'd cut all three pieces of the body which I had measured to 40mm, I had a moment to consider the size of the guitar.

Back to the routing. I needed to route a control-cavity (where the knobs, pickup selector and output jack would go) for the bottom piece of the body. I had the idea that I could use the existing pickup cavity jig with some different sized routing bits and a bit of shuffling between routing passes to save myself from having to make a new routing jig. I experimented on a piece of scrap first, which was a success, then I moved onto the real deal.

![recessed-control-cavity](recessed-control-cavity.jpg)
Routed control cavity, with recessed lip.

This worked pretty well, and the result was a cavity with a 2mm recess around the edges where I can screw down a piece of metal of plastic with the knobs/jack/switch attached. I drilled a hole from the cavity to the side of the timber where the pickup wiring channel was located.

![wires-threaded-to-control-pocket](wires-threaded-to-control-pocket.jpg)
Threading the pickup wires through the pickup cavities and through to the control cavity, to check the diameters and the alignment.

So, with all the routing and cutting complete, it was time to "laminate" (glue) the body together. Just before I did though, I took the opportunity to save myself the headache of trying to thread wiring through the finished body by threading a little bit of string through. This means that I would only have to tie the cables to the end of the strings and pull the strings through.

Once all pieces were glued, I clamed them together with a set of cheap F clamps which I'd bought from Bunnings (and a couple of bits of scrap wood either side to protect the body) but it turned out they weren't really worth money as they just bent under their own force. So, I upgraded to a pair of heavy duty sash clamps, which I had thought were probably going to be overkill.

About 24 hours later, I came back to check on the laminated body, and it looks bloody fantastic!
